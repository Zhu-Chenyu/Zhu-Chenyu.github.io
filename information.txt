Built, coded, designed, and debugged a competition robot from scratch within 2 weeks during internship in General Electrics. It was a group work, and I was mainly listening to feedbacks from group members and finish the work independently. Eventually got a 3rd place among 10 teams. (This was my first coding and designing a robot.)

Coded and debugged a robot that can locate a pen using RealSense camera and find a collision-free path to pick it up. All finished in 2 days in my hackathon(prepare course) for graduate study.

 Calculus knowledge isn't required in my high school, so I was first exposed to it in my undergraduate. However, I still managed to get top 10% in a very hard calculus exam in class when most of my classmates had learned calculus for 2 years.
